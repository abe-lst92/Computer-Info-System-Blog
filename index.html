    <div>
        <iframe style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"
            src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SeX3sAFiZSIM4n1eWzWW2vuSIpmHNNHF/preview" width="640"
            height="480"></iframe>

    </div>

    <ul>
        <li> What is a network? The network is a connection to servers in order to communicate with others such
            as
            friends,
            family, e.t.c. I think we use the network so often that we don’t even realize what it is.</li>

        <li> What’s the difference between the web and the internet? The difference between web and internet is
            that
            web
            is
            only one storage center of your own data or someone else's data but as the internet the data from
            everyone
            goes
            and leaves through. Web could be a type of communication and the internet is kind of more than just
            communication.</li>

        <li> The internet is not a physical place or chip, so how would you explain it? I would describe the
            internet as
            binary system 0’s and 1’s going out and coming back. Another way that I can explain the internet is
            as
            the
            main
            brain of everything coding, data, servers and others.</li>

        <li>How is ISP related to the internet? Instead of having a router there is this fiber optic that brings
            signal
            to
            our services and gets better access to any app that uses wifi.</li>

        <li>Why was the internet created, when? I think the internet was created to help people communicate with
            others,
            Learn about other’s experiences. In a few words, to make people become more independent by
            themselves.
        </li>

        <li>What is DNS and why is it necessary? The DNS is necessary because we can get an accessible way to
            the
            url.
        </li>

        <li> How has the internet expanded in the last 10 years in relation to computers?
            The internet has changed to makes our lives more easy and not get very complicated, now we can have
            access
            to
            anything such as jobs, maps, articles, e.t.c and what I see is that no only internet will evolved
            but
            technology
            will and it will make a better version for the internet hoping that one day the internet could
            become to
            positive effects instead of negatives.</li>
