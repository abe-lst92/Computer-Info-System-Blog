    <ul>
        <li> What is a network? The network is a connection to servers in order to communicate with others such as
            friends,
            family, e.t.c. I think we use the network so often that we don’t even realize what it is.</li>

        <li> What’s the difference between the web and the internet? The difference between web and internet is that web
            is
            only one storage center of your own data or someone else's data but as the internet the data from everyone
            goes
            and leaves through. Web could be a type of communication and the internet is kind of more than just
            communication.</li>

        <li> The internet is not a physical place or chip, so how would you explain it? I would describe the internet as
            binary system 0’s and 1’s going out and coming back. Another way that I can explain the internet is as the
            main
            brain of everything coding, data, servers and others.</li>

        <li>How is ISP related to the internet? Instead of having a router there is this fiber optic that brings signal
            to
            our services and gets better access to any app that uses wifi.</li>

        <li>Why was the internet created, when? I think the internet was created to help people communicate with others,
            Learn about other’s experiences. In a few words, to make people become more independent by themselves.</li>

        <li>What is DNS and why is it necessary? The DNS is necessary because we can get an accessible way to the url.
        </li>

        <li> How has the internet expanded in the last 10 years in relation to computers?
            The internet has changed to makes our lives more easy and not get very complicated, now we can have access
            to
            anything such as jobs, maps, articles, e.t.c and what I see is that no only internet will evolved but
            technology
            will and it will make a better version for the internet hoping that one day the internet could become to
            positive effects instead of negatives.</li>

    <!-- <div class="flexbox-container"> -->
    <!-- <div class="flexbox-item flex-one"> -->
    <h3>Input: </h3>
    There is the switch to turn light on and lights off adding to that switch it could be a microphone on it
    which in that microphone it can detect when you clap or wisel. Using the claps it can turn the lights on and
    specify how high or low you want the lights to come up.

    <h3> CPU and Memory:</h3>
    <p>There is this amplifier that the microphone is connected to. What this amplifier is the main brain and
        saves
        what
        the memory should have to identify the sounds around the microphone in order to activate the lights of
        the
        home.
        which it controls the lights</p>

    <h3>Output:</h3>
    <p>Using the claps it can turn the lights on and specify how
        high or low you want the lights to come up. Depending on how hard or how weak the amplifier detects the
        clap
        or
        the wisel it will make the lights brighters or not brighters. wiseling it wil change the color of the
        lights
        using the Rbgs color. </p>
